# FDSReader
> Python reader for FDS data

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JanVogelsang/fdsreader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JanVogelsang/fdsreader)

[ToDo: One to two paragraph statement about the fdsreader package.]

![](https://via.placeholder.com/250)

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip:  
```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade fdsreader
```

## Usage example
```python
import fdsreader as fds

# Creates an instance of a simulation master-class which manages all data for a given simulation
sim = fds.Simulation("./sample_data")

# Examples of data that can be easily accessed
print(sim.meshes, sim.meshes[0].obstructions, sim.surfaces, sim.slices, sim.boundaries, sim.data_3d, sim.isosurfaces)
```
